recordtrac-cakephp
==================
This is a port of [RecordTrac] (https://github.com/postcode/recordtrac) using [CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org) as the framework. 
Although this project is called a "port," it does not follow the same conventions for JSON files and DB as the original RecordTrac.
